# VoirTrack

GPX Chemin is a simple web-app to visualize GPX files on a map.
Files can be added by dropping files over Drop files here area or by clicking on Add files to select from file manager.
If files are added by using file browser, click on Plot to load the track on the map. No action is needed when files are dropped over drop area, tracks get loaded automatically.
Single or multiple files can be added at once, or can be added progressively.
On the right side, all the basic stats of each track such as title, date, distance, speed, elevation, and heart rate are displayed.
The color of each stat box matches with the color of the respective line on the map.
Under the map are three graphs, one each for speed (blue), elevation (teal), and heart rate (red).
Stats and graphs are displayed only when a track is loaded, if you don't have any gpx file with you, click on Test to load a demo track.
